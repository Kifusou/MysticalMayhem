Content
-----------
| Option | Type | Description | Homebrew |
|:-----:|:----:|-------------------------------------|:---:|
|Flagellant|Archetype|A cleric archetype designed by Kobold Press.<br>Can get bonuses to DC and CL by sacrificing health. Very powerful with the right domains for a casting-focused cleric.|Yes|
|Pact Wizard|Archetype|Haunted Heroes Handbook version. A wizard who trades bonus feats for a witch patron, an oracle curse and other goodies.|No|
|Razmiran Priest|Archetype|Not the prestige class but the sorcerer archetype. Loses a few bloodline spells and one bloodline power in exchange for infinite scrolls and wands as long as you have enough spells per day to cover them.<br>Slightly nerfed from their tabletop equivalent as their abilities only work with spells on the cleric list instead of all divine spells. Still very overpowered but you have to live with the shame of worshipping a level 19 wizard who has to beg Tar-Baphon to leave him alone.|No|
|Warsighted|Archetype|A more fighter-y oracle archetype who loses revelations in favor of fighter bonus feats.|No|
|Acadamae Graduate|Feat|Cast full-round summoning spells as standard actions but with a Fortitude save to avoid being fatigued.|No|
|Earth Magic|Feat|+1 CL when on your favorite terrain.|No|
|Purity of Sin|Feat|Thassilonian Specialist only. +2 CL for the school of magic associated with the sin.<br>Becomes an arcane discovery if Tabletop Tweaks Base is installed.|Yes|
|School Expertise|Feat|Arcane school powers can be used 3 additional times. Can be taken multiple times.<br>Becomes an arcane discovery if Tabletop Tweaks Base is installed.|Yes|
|Staff-like Wand|Feat|Calculate wands CL and DC with the wizard's caster level and stats.<br>Becomes an arcane discovery if Tabletop Tweaks Base is installed.|No|
|Circle of Order|Magus Arcana|Adds half the magus level to AC against Chaotic enemies for 1 round.|No|
|Malice|Magus Arcana (Hexcrafter only)|Originally designed by Rite Publishing.<br>The hexcrafter's attacks deal an additional 2d6 unholy damage to targets under the effect of their hexes.|Yes|
|Material Freedom|Mythic Ability|Can ignore a specific material spell component (Diamond, Jade, etc...).|Yes|
|Purity of Sin (Mythic)|Mythic Feat|Purity of Sin also grants +2 bonus to DC.|Yes|
|Manifestations|Shaman Features|Add the capstones to Shaman spirits. They have been adapted to the game the same way Owlcat adapted the final revelations for Oracle mysteries (they're virtually identical).|No|

Settings
-----------
Because this mod uses Mod Menu, settings are in the game settings: Settings > Mods > Mystical Mayhem. There is only one so far, allowing you to disable all homebrew content if you desire.

FAQ & Troubleshooting
-----------
**Q:** Something doesn't work!
<br>**A:** Create an [issue](https://github.com/kreaddy/MysticalMayhem/issues) and describe **what** doesn't work and how I could reproduce it, if possible. You can also ping me in the #mod-user-general channel of the [Owlcat discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat) (kreaddy#3461).

**Q:** What about Magic Time?
<br>**A:** Magic Time was the first mod I ever made for a Unity game so I felt the need to rebuild it from the ground up.

**Q:** No Blood Arcanist or metamagic?
<br>**A:** Most of my old metamagic feats and arcane discoveries have been remade in [Tabletop Tweaks](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base). Likewise, Blood Arcanist and Mythic Poison are now in [Homebrew Archetypes](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/279).

**Q:** Can you add X?
<br>**A:** Maybe. Make a feature request and I'll add it if I feel like it. No promises though.

**Q:** Your naming sense sucks.
<br>**A:** I'm just a fan of Ogre Battle and Might & Magic ;_;
